  abstract={Hardware Trojan (HT) has become a serious threat to the Internet of Things due to the globalization of the integrated circuit industry. To evade functional verification, HTs tend to have at least one trigger signal at the gate-level netlist with a very low transition probability. Based on this nature, previous studies use imbalanced controllability as a feature to detect HTs, assuming that signals with imbalanced controllability are always accompanied by low transition probability. However, this study has found out a way to create a new type of HT that has low transition probability but balanced controllability, against previous methods. Hence, current imbalanced controllability detectors are inadequate in this scenario. To address this limitation, we propose a probability-based detection method that uses unsupervised anomaly analysis to detect HTs. Our proposed method detects not only the proposed HT but also the 580 Trojan benchmarks on Trusthub. Experimental results show that our proposed detector outperforms other detectors, achieving an overall 100% TPR and 0.37% FPR on the 580 benchmarks.},

  abstract={The division of labor in the integrated circuit (IC) industry has become more detailed. Outsourcing IC design or fabrication to third-party vendors is inevitable, which has caused a variety of hardware security issues. With the attention of hardware Trojan, most recent research has focused on detection techniques instead of attack or insertion methods. Existing detection methods for gate level can be classified into two categories: one based on circuit structure features and the other based on the Sandia Controllability/Observability Analysis Program (SCOAP) values. This paper proposes a new hardware Trojan insertion framework that can automatically construct Trojan with low SCOAP values against both structural features-based and SCOAP-based detection techniques. In our framework, we use the greedy algorithm to build a Trojan structure similar to a genuine circuit as much as possible and then reduce SCOAP values by inserting genuine nets. The experimental results demonstrated that our greedy method achieves significant improvements in structure generation than the random method. Moreover, the insertion framework can reduce the average SCOAP values by 68% after inserting three genuine nets. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art detection techniques using hardware Trojan samples generated by our proposed framework, which provides a high False Positive Rate (FPR)/False Negative Rate (FNR) and low accuracy.},

  abstract={Recently, hardware Trojan has become a serious security concern in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. Due to the globalization of semiconductor design and fabrication processes, ICs are highly vulnerable to hardware Trojan insertion by malicious third-party vendors. Therefore, the development of effective hardware Trojan detection techniques is necessary. Testability measures have been proven to be efficient features for Trojan nets classification. However, most of the existing machine-learning-based techniques use supervised learning methods, which involve time-consuming training processes, need to deal with the class imbalance problem, and are not pragmatic in real-world situations. Furthermore, no works have explored the use of anomaly detection for hardware Trojan detection tasks. This paper proposes a semi-supervised hardware Trojan detection method at the gate level using anomaly detection. We ameliorate the existing computation of the Sandia Controllability/Observability Analysis Program (SCOAP) values by considering all types of D flip-flops and adopt semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques to detect Trojan nets. Finally, a novel topology-based location analysis is utilized to improve the detection performance. Testing on 17 Trust-Hub Trojan benchmarks, the proposed method achieves an overall 99.47% true positive rate (TPR), 99.99% true negative rate (TNR), and 99.99% accuracy.},
